<div class="textblock"><div class="input_file"></div><div class="input_file"><h1>1. Introduction</h1>
</div><div class="input_file"> Dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) attempt to calculate the distribution of carbon in vegetation and soils and how these will evolve under changing climate and changes in the concentrations of CO2 and N in the atmosphere. Their approach is based on representing the biophysical processes by which carbon is fixed and transported within the atmosphere-soil-vegetation system. Originally they were designed for global scale calculations that indicate trends and interactions, rather than for detailed calculations of the carbon budget. Applying them to greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting in Siberia therefore requires evaluation of their suitability for this task; in particular, it is necessary to establish whether they adequately describe all the relevant processes determining GHG concentrations and fluxes in this region. In addition, most of the current DVMs make limited use of external data, other than coarse scale soil type maps and idealised climate. As a result, their connection to the actual state of terrestrial vegetation is rather weak and it is important to establish much stronger links between the models and data. Here remote sensing data are especially needed, because of their consistent, global, repetitive and consistent description of surface variables.</div><div class="input_file">This report has three main objectives:<ol type="1">
<li>to explain the structure and functioning of current DVMs;</li>
<li>to clarify their role in GHG accounting;</li>
<li>to clarify their use of external data and how the models may have to be changed in order to make better use of available data sources, especially those provided by remote sensing. The first section is a high-level but fairly thorough explanation of the structure of the Sheffield Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (SDGVM). This is typical of the current generation of DVMs, and give insight into the whole class of models (a review of six of the leading DVMs, including LPJ and SDGVM, is given in Cramer et al., 2001). This explanation of how the models work is followed by a description of their strengths and weaknesses as regards their potential use for GHG accounting in Siberia. The report concludes with a summary of measured parameters that could in principle be used in the models, together with brief indications of the difficulties involved in doing so. This last section pulls together remarks made throughout the report.</li>
</ol>
</div><div class="input_file"><h1>2. Dynamic Vegetation Models</h1>
</div><div class="input_file"> DVMs were originally designed to model the response of terrestrial ecosystems to long-term atmospheric changes in temperature, precipitation and gas concentrations (CO2 and N). The typical structure of a DVM is shown in Figure 1. A core set of coupled modules represents the interactions of ecosystem carbon and water exchanges with vegetation dynamics, under given soil and atmospheric conditions. The biochemical processes of photosynthesis and the dependence of gas exchange on stomatal conductance are explicitly modelled; these depend on temperature and soil moisture. Canopy conductance controls soil water loss by transpiration. The assignment of nitrogen uptake to leaf layers is proportional to irradiance and respiration, and maximum assimilation rates depend on nitrogen uptake and temperature. Total nitrogen uptake is derived from soil carbon and nitrogen and depends on temperature. The intrinsic timescales of the processes are indicated in Figure 1. In practice, averaging and interpolation are used to deal with the most rapid effects (which are embodied in the vegetation physiology and biophysics module), thereby reducing the computational load.</div><div class="input_file">The great strength of such models is their generality and predictive capability: by accurately representing the biophysical processes involved, they allow credible calculations of the long-term behaviour of vegetation systems under changing climate. However, in order to achieve this, they necessarily use generalised descriptions of the system. In particular: a) current DVMs use the concept of potential vegetation (i.e., vegetation growing without constraints imposed by human interference); b) vegetation is represented by generalised functional types, rather than by species; c) the only interaction with external data is through the imposed soil and atmospheric conditions; d) the models only deal with the role of CO2 in the carbon cycle, and currently neglect other GHGs, such as CH4.</div><div class="input_file"><div class="image">

<div class="caption">
Fig 1: General Structure of a DVM</div></div>
</div><div class="input_file">The Sheffield Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (SDGVM) and the PIK LPJ models both have the general structure of Figure 1. In the following sections we describe the SDGVM, the main differences from LPJ are noted in Section 4.</div><div class="input_file"><h2>3. The Sheffield Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (SDGVM)</h2>
</div><div class="input_file"> Section 3 is organised into a series of subsections that explain the underlying concepts of the SDGVM, the main component modules, and how the calculations are actually carried out.</div><div class="input_file"><h2>3.1 Fundamental Concepts</h2>
</div><div class="input_file"></div><div class="input_file"><h3>3.1.1 Point and Area Representations</h3>
</div><div class="input_file"> In principle, the SDGVM is a point model, i.e., there is no area associated with a particular point and all variables produced by the model are per unit area. A point where the model is run, defined by its latitude and longitude, is referred to as a site. Resources available at a site are exclusive to that site and there are no interactions between sites. In practice, each site is considered to be representative of some area. For example, the SDGVM might be run globally on the 0.5o x 0.5o latitude-longitude grid from the UEA (University of East Anglia) climate data set, or on a 2.5o x 3.75o GCM (General Circulation Model) climate data set. If the DVMs are to be run at a finer (kilometric) scale in SIBERIA-II, it will be necessary to investigate whether decreasing the area associated with a grid point invalidates any of the assumptions underlying the model.</div><div class="input_file"><h3>3.1.2 Plant Functional Types and Their Parameterisation</h3>
</div><div class="input_file"> The basic concept for describing vegetation in the SDGVM is that of the plant functional type (PFT), all modelled vegetation is described by a number such types (the maximum number, maxNft, is set to ten in the source code but can easily be altered). Within the SDGVM, and the output files it produces, the PFTs are referenced sequentially, in the order that they appear in the input file. The first PFT (1) is reserved to represent bare ground, and as such does not require a PFT parameterisation in the input file. The second and third PFTs (2 &amp; 3) are reserved to represent grass, a parameterisation for each must be present in the input file; the remainder (4+) are used to represent trees. The trees and grasses are treated differently in the way in which new vegetation is allowed to propagate, described in section 3.5.2. Two PFTs are set aside for grasses to allow for C3 and C4, the photosynthetic pathway is set in the parameterisation.</div><div class="input_file">A fraction of the area associated with each site is allocated to each PFT. These fractions have no spatial arrangement within the site. Unvegetated land is given over to bare ground, and bare ground is available for growth by the PFTs as specified by ‘landuse’ in the input file.</div><div class="input_file">The PFTs are currently described by seventeen parameters. Each PFT parameterisation is specified in the input file by a record containing seventeen space-delimited fields.</div><div class="input_file"><ol>
<li>
life-span: The maximum age that a PFT can attain. Vegetation dies once it reaches this age. </li>
<li>
wood density (t C m-3): </li>
<li>
xylem conductivity (10-9 m3 s-1): </li>
<li>

<li>
photosynthetic pathway: C3 C4 pathway, 1 = C3, 0 = C4.  </li>
<li>
specific leaf area (m2 kg-1): The cost, in terms of carbon, to produce a leaf of unit area is inversely proportional to the SLA.  </li>
<li>

</ol>
</div><div class="input_file"><h2>3.2 Driving Variables: Soil and Atmospheric Descriptors</h2>
</div><div class="input_file"> As Figure 1 shows, calculations with the SDGVM require information on the soil and atmospheric conditions. These depend on the latitude-longitude position of the site; latitude is also important in determining the radiation and daylight hours at the site.</div><div class="input_file">For the timescales of a DVM run, the soil conditions (which refer only to texture and depth; organic content is calculated within the model) are effectively constant. Soil texture is given as percentages of clay, sand and silt, which sum to 100%. These determine the soil hydrological characteristics, and are also parameters used in the computation of the soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics. The default option for soil texture is to use an ISLSCP soil texture map (International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project CD-ROM, published March 1995). This is a global categorisation of soil texture on a 1o by 1o scale, with the categories as given in Table 2. Note that field capacity and wilting points are given as fractions. To obtain actual capacities these fractions are multiplied by soil depth. In the SDGVM, all of the hydrological variables depend purely on depth within the soil layer, due to the per area rationale. The soil depth is currently set to 1m everywhere, although an ISLSCP soil depth map is available. The impact of soil depth has not been studied in any detail.</div><div class="input_file">The climatic variables used to drive the SDGVM are precipitation, relative humidity and temperature, provided either daily or as monthly averages derived from meteorological station data. When monthly data are used, more realistic precipitation patterns are simulated using a ‘rain generator’. This predicts the number of wet days in a month given the total monthly precipitation, and divides the precipitation equally between these wet days. Dry and wet days are arranged as uniformly as possible within the month.</div><div class="input_file"><table class="input_file_table">

</div><div class="input_file">Temperatures are treated as constant throughout each month for the purpose of calculating biochemical processes, and minimum temperatures required for PFT allocation are estimated from monthly averages. The atmospheric CO2 concentration is a yearly average given as a partial pressure. The default CO2 data cover the period 1830-2100 and were produced by the Hadley Centre.</div><div class="input_file"><h2>3.3 State Variables of the SDGVM</h2>
</div><div class="input_file"> The state of the soil-vegetation system at a particular site and time is given by specifying the following variables:</div><div class="input_file">Soil Variables</div><div class="input_file">soil moisture: The soil moisture profile is given as depths of water in a series of layers. Six separate pools are modelled: 4 soil layers, a snow pool and a liquid snow pool.</div><div class="input_file">soil carbon: Eight soil carbon pools are modelled: surface and soil structural material, active soil organic matter, surface microbes, surface and soil metabolic material, slow and passive soil organic material.</div><div class="input_file">soil nitrogen: Eight soil nitrogen pools are modelled, as for soil carbon.</div><div class="input_file">Vegetation Variables</div><div class="input_file">cover and cover elements: A site contains a proportion of each PFT, which is further divided into age in years. The total fraction of cover taken up by each PFT is given by summing the contributions at each age. The cover corresponding to a specific age and PFT is referred to as a cover element. For example, one such cover element would be the fraction of cover taken up by 5 year old evergreen broadleaf trees.</div><div class="input_file">leaf, stem and root biomass: The carbon equivalent biomass of each cover element is partitioned into leaf, stem (or trunk for trees) and root biomass.</div><div class="input_file">leaf area index (LAI): This dimensionless variable specifies the area of leaf per area of vegetation. All cover elements of a particular PFT have the same LAI. The LAI variable is further split into age in days, this is allows leaf mortality to be implemented.</div><div class="input_file">net primary productivity (NPP): The net annual carbon gain through photosynthesis after allowing for respiration. All cover elements of a particular PFT have the same NPP.</div><div class="input_file">number density: The number of plants per m2 for each cover element (trees only).</div><div class="input_file">height: Tree trunks are modelled as cylinders, whose height is given by this variable. No height is assigned to grasses.</div><div class="input_file">litter: Intermediate carbon pool, providing inputs for the soil carbon sub-system. The pool is fed by dead vegetation and is partitioned into leaves stems and roots.</div><div class="input_file">NPP_store: Intermediate carbon store from which vegetation (leaves, stems and roots) is formed, this is fed by NPP. A maximum value of this variable is defined in the FT parameterisation. The maximum value defines the ability of the vegetation to withstand years of low productivity.</div><div class="input_file">daily_leaf: leaf carbon partitioned into age in days.</div><div class="input_file">daily_stem: active stem carbon partitioned into age in days. This information is required to compute the stem respiration, which only occurs for the active stem biomass, stem biomass ceases to respires after stem_ll days, currently set to 365 for all PFTs.</div><div class="input_file">daily_root: active root carbon partitioned into age in days. This information is required to compute root respiration, which only occurs for the active root biomass, root biomass no-longer respires after root_ll days, currently set to 365 for all PFTs.</div><div class="input_file">These variables allow a range of descriptors, such as age profiles, histograms or average parameters, to be calculated for each PFT.</div><div class="input_file">It is the rationale within the SDGVM, to share resources between all cover elements of all fts. This is achieved by pooling together resources from each of the cover elements at the end of a year. At the onset of the following year the pooled resource value is used by all cover elements of all fts. Specifically, the resources are soil moisture, litter and soil carbon &amp; nitrogen.</div><div class="input_file">The condition of the system at a given time 0 is described completely by the state vector, , containing this set of state variables. Since the state vector includes a complete description of the age structure of each PFT and the biomass allocation at each age, it carries the history of the processes that have occurred at each site. This is important, because:</div><div class="input_file">a) Knowledge of averaged quantities at a given time will not normally provide the full information carried in the state vector;</div><div class="input_file">b) Inaccurate description of processes occurring through time will cause the state vector to depart from the actual state at a site. This is particularly important for processes that are introduced in a probabilistic way, such as fire and other forms of disturbance.</div><div class="input_file">The dynamics of the model lie in the transition from state to state as time progresses, i.e., the SDGVM is a method of moving between states: S(t0) -&gt; S(tf). The basic time-step is one year, but this integrates processes that occur on daily or shorter timescales. These processes and their interactions are described in Section 3.4.</div><div class="input_file"><h2>3.4 Component Modules of the SDGVM</h2>
</div><div class="input_file"> The overall structure of the SDGVM is shown in Figure 2. There are five main components, dealing with soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics, hydrology, calculation of NPP, phenology and vegetation growth, with interactions as indicated in the Figure. We first describe these sub-models, before describing how they knit together to form the SDGVM.</div><div class="input_file"></div> </div></div><!-- contents -->
